# Import sorting

Ended up using "@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports"
Instead of "eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort"

## Winning Thought

Eslint sorting is just maintained by a guy
Also the guy said prettier would be [better](https://github.com/lydell/eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort/issues/105)

Generally placing imports is more of a code style
And we have eslint linting imports
So generally as long as it works, it is alright

## Other thoughts

Trying out the eslint method is worth a try
Only thing I could think off that would push in other favor is import order mattered
