# Learn Gatsby

Starting new line of repos (hopefully) where each one is for me to play, test and learn new tech.
Seems fun

Remember to use `nvm use` before running commands

## Goals

1. [ ] Learn how to properly build an app with Gatsby (Like package handling, building in docker and dev envs) (Need to expand this point)
2. [ ] Learn to implement proper testing in Gatsby
3. [ ] Implement some sort of ci/cd
4. [ ] Try to use more of the community features on github
5. [ ] Try and incorporate design into this (whimsical and figma?)

## Conventions

### Interface and Style

Follow recommended linting by eslint
Use prettier for style

### Emotion CSS Styling

Keep styling as close as possible to the component/page
Should be done in component (Idea being if its only for 1 thing, it does not need to be exported)
Then have the general themes/styles handle the rest
Also remember the overriding
